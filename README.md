# CS-300-DSA
Works written for CS-300 Data Structures and Algorithms

Code Reflection:

  "ABC University" wants to develop an application which takes a CSV file of courses as input, and allows the
  user to view a course and it's prerequisites or print all the courses in the cirriculum. The courses should 
  be sorted in alphanumeric order.

  The data structure chosen for the application affects the runtime efficiency, so I first analyzed several 
  data structures and their runtimes for the tasks I need to implement. Populating a data structure requires
  inserting data, and sorting the structure requires moving the data or the direction of pointers. 

  I ran into several roadblocks while coding. My initial code to parse the CSV file and sort the courses did not
  function properly. This did not get in my way for long, because I added print statemtents for debugging which
  indicated the incorrect snippets in my sorting algorithm. 

  This is the first application I have developed in which I felt confident while coding. The designing phase lasted 
  for a couple weeks, which is why I went into the coding with the confidence I was making an efficient console application. 
  I learned a lot about the importance of psuedocode; getting the creative juices flowing and allowing me to think about 
  the application in an abstract way really facilitated the ease of coding.

  Working on the project has also enhanced my commenting format and content. I have noticed a comment above a function 
  that describes it's parameters or purpose is very helpful for another programmer reading into the code to maintain it or adapt it.
